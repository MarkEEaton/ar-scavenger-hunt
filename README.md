This is our AR tour game that we built for our library. It allows students to roam around the library and find colorful shapes floating in the virtual space. These shapes are found at important library service points. The students collect them all to "win" the game.

If you want to run this game on a LibGuides group homepage, you should use commit [ab86398](https://github.com/MarkEEaton/ar-scavenger-hunt/tree/ab8639815cc5daf3989ec9769d132519b58256df), which uses AR.js, and which was the last version of the game developed for LibGuides. Since then, the focus has been on developing this for PythonAnyhwere.
