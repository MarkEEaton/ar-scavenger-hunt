## An Augmented Reality library tour, built on LibGuides ##

This is an attempt to build an AR tour for our library using LibGuides. I'll admit that this is a bit of a stretch of what LibGuides is normally used for, but for better or worse, it's our CMS, and we'll build what we can with it.

There are limitations here. Some files that you'd might want to upload to customize the AR.js experience are not uploadable in LibGuides. I also wanted to use Vue.js as a framework, but it was easier to stick with AFrame. I've worked around these problems as much as I can. It's a hack, but it's a fun one :)
