This is our AR tour game that we built for our library. It allows students to roam around the library and find colorful shapes floating in the virtual space. These shapes are found at important library service points. The students collect them all to "win" the game.

#### This project was built with the invaluable contributions of Prof. Carrie Jedlicka.
